8,ARDUINO,SEN18 Water Sensor,"S (Signal) is an analog output pin that will be connected to one of your Arduino’s analog inputs. + (VCC) pin provides power to the sensor. It is recommended that the sensor be powered from 3.3V to 5V. Please keep in mind that the analog output will vary depending on the voltage supplied to the sensor. – (GND) is the ground pin. To begin, connect the + (VCC) pin on the module to 5V on the Arduino and the – (GND) pin to ground. One well-known issue with these sensors is that they have a shorter lifespan because they are constantly exposed to moisture. Moreover, constantly applying power to the sensor while immersed in water significantly accelerates the rate of corrosion. To avoid this, it is recommended that the sensor be turned on only when taking readings. One easy way to do this is to connect the sensor’s power pin to a digital pin on an Arduino and set it to HIGH or LOW as needed. So, we’ll connect the + (VCC) pin to the Arduino’s digital pin #7.
